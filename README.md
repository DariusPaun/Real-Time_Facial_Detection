# Face Recognition Project

## Overview
This project is a real-time face recognition system implemented using Python and OpenCV. It detects faces in live video streams or recorded videos and recognizes them if they are present in the dataset.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Ability to recognize multiple faces simultaneously.
- Support for both live video streams and recorded videos.
- Flexible dataset management for adding and removing faces.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or Keras (for deep learning-based face recognition)
- (Optional) CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN for GPU acceleration

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
2. Install dependencies:    pip install -r requirements.txt
